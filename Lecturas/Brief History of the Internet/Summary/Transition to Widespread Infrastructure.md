# The Great Unification: NSFNET and the Path to Privatization

By the mid-1970s, many "purpose-built" networks emerged for specific communities. However, these networks were largely incompatible until the **NSFNET** mandated a universal standard.
## 1. The Era of Fragmented Networks (Mid-1970s – 1980s)
Before the Internet became a singular entity, various agencies built "closed" networks:
* **Energy (DoE):** MFENet (Magnetic Fusion) and HEPNet (High Energy Physics).
* **Space (NASA):** SPAN (Space Physics).
* **Academics:** **CSNET** (Computer Science) and **BITNET** (IBM Mainframes).
* **Grassroots:** **USENET**, spawned by the free dissemination of UNIX and UUCP protocols.
* **Commercial Competitors:** XNS (Xerox), DECNet, and IBM's SNA.
## 2. NSFNET: The Universal Catalyst (1985–1995)
The **National Science Foundation (NSF)** changed the trajectory of the Internet by insisting on two revolutionary policies:
1. **TCP/IP Mandate:** Under Dennis Jennings (1985), NSF made TCP/IP mandatory, forcing diverse networks to speak the same language.
2. **Universal Access:** NSF funding required universities to make the connection available to **ALL** qualified users on campus, regardless of discipline.
### Federal Coordination
* **Interoperability:** RFC 985 formally ensured that DARPA’s and NSF’s pieces of the Internet worked together.
* **Infrastructure Sharing:** Agencies shared the cost of trans-oceanic circuits and created **FIX-E and FIX-W** (Federal Internet Exchanges), the blueprints for today's Network Access Points (NAPs).
## 3. The Strategy of Privatization
**Steve Wolff (1986)** recognized that the Internet could not rely on federal funding forever. A clever two-step strategy was used to stimulate a private market:

1.  **The Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):** The NSFNET Backbone prohibited commercial traffic.
2.  **Regional Encouragement:** NSF encouraged regional networks to seek commercial customers. 

> [!important] The Result
> Since commercial traffic was allowed at the regional level but **banned** on the national backbone, private companies were forced to build their own long-haul networks (e.g., **PSI, UUNET**). This birth of a competitive private market was the intended "privatization."
## 4. The "Information Superhighway" (1988–1995)
Key reports by the National Research Council (chaired by **Leonard Kleinrock** with Kahn and Clark) influenced **Senator Al Gore** and provided the blueprint for the "Information Superhighway."

* **1988 Report:** "Towards a National Research Network" – ushered in high-speed networking.
* **1994 Report:** "Realizing The Information Future" – anticipated issues like intellectual property, ethics, pricing, and regulation.
* **April 1995:** The NSFNET Backbone was officially **defunded**, completing the transition to a privately-financed Internet.
