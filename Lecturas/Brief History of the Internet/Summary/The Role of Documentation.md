# The Open Standards Model: RFCs and Community Governance

The Internet's rapid growth is inextricably linked to its culture of **open access** to basic documentation and a collaborative, non-hierarchical approach to engineering.
## 1. The RFC (Request for Comments) Process
In 1969, **Steve Crocker** established the **RFC** series to bypass the slow cycle of traditional academic publishing. 
### Key Characteristics of RFCs:
* **Evolution of Distribution:** Originally printed on paper and sent via snail mail; then shared via **FTP**; now ubiquitous on the **World Wide Web**.
* **Positive Feedback Loop:** One RFC triggers another, creating a rapid dialogue that eventually congeals into a technical specification.
* **The "Document of Record":** Today, RFCs are the official standards for Internet engineering.
* **Jon Postel:** Served as the long-time RFC Editor and managed protocol number assignments until 1998.

> [!important] Impact on Education
> Because RFCs are free and open, they are used as primary examples in college classrooms and by entrepreneurs, fueling a continuous cycle of innovation.
## 2. The Evolution of Governance Bodies
As the community grew from a handful of researchers to a global commercial force, the organizational structure evolved to maintain coordination.
### The Organizational Timeline
* **Late 1970s:** Vint Cerf (DARPA) forms the **ICCB** (Internet Configuration Control Board) to manage growth.
* **1983:** The ICCB is replaced by the **IAB** (Internet Activities Board), organized into specialized Task Forces.
* **1985–1989:** The **IETF** (Internet Engineering Task Force) explodes in size. It introduces **Working Groups** and the **IESG** (Internet Engineering Steering Group) to manage standards.
* **1991:** The **Internet Society (ISOC)** is formed under Kahn and Cerf to provide a professional home and community support for the Internet.
* **1992:** The IAB is renamed the **Internet Architecture Board** and moves under the auspices of the Internet Society.
## 3. The Hierarchy of Modern Internet Organizations

| Organization | Full Name | Primary Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IETF** | Internet Engineering Task Force | The "engine room" where working groups develop protocol standards. |
| **IAB** | Internet Architecture Board | Provides long-range technical direction and oversight. |
| **IRTF** | Internet Research Task Force | Focuses on long-term research topics (anti-spam, crypto, etc.). |
| **W3C** | World Wide Web Consortium | Led by **Tim Berners-Lee**; evolves protocols specifically for the Web. |
## 4. The "Community of Communities"
The Internet’s success is as much about people as technology. 
* **The Academic Tradition:** Early researchers at UCLA and SRI formed a "close-knit community" that used the very tools they were building (Email, File Sharing) to coordinate the building of the network.
* **Mailing Lists:** Specialized email lists became (and remain) the primary tool for developing protocol specifications.
* **Inclusivity:** The shift from DARPA-only funding to a mix of NSF and commercial interests forced the standards process to become "open and fair."
