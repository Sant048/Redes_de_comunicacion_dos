# From Research to Commodity: The Commercial Era

The transition of the Internet into the commercial sector required moving away from proprietary "walled gardens" (like IBM's SNA or DECNet) toward a unified, interoperable TCP/IP standard.
## 1. The Interoperability Breakthrough (1985–1988)
In the early 1980s, vendors treated TCP/IP as a "nuisance add-on." To bridge the gap between inventors and vendors, a new collaborative model was formed.
### The Dan Lynch Workshops (1985)
* **The Goal:** 250 vendor personnel met with 50 DARPA inventors to learn how TCP/IP actually worked.
* **The Culture Clash:** Vendors were shocked by the "openness" of researchers, while researchers gained insights into real-world field problems.
### The Birth of "Interop" (1988)
* **The First Show:** 50 companies demonstrated that their products could work together in one room. 
* **The Legacy:** Interop proved that a multi-vendor environment was possible. Today, it serves over 250,000 people globally, ensuring that "seamless" networking remains a reality.
## 2. Network Management: The Rise of SNMP
As the network scaled, manual table configuration became impossible. A standard was needed to manage routers and hardware remotely.
### The Contenders (1987):
1. **HEMS:** Complex research-grade design (withdrawn).
2. **CMIP:** The OSI community's long-term approach.
3. **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):** Designed for immediate simplicity.
* **The Outcome:** The market chose **SNMP**, which is now used almost universally for global network management.
## 3. The Modern Phase: The "Commodity" Internet
The final evolution shifted the focus from the *technology* of the connection to the *services* provided on top of it.

* **Connectivity as a Commodity:** Basic Internet access became a standard utility.
* **The Web Catalyst:** The rapid adoption of **browsers** and **World Wide Web** technology accelerated the use of the Internet for sophisticated information services.
* **Current State:** Most innovation now occurs at the "Application Layer," providing global information services on top of the established TCP/IP infrastructure.
## 4. Summary of Commercial Evolution

| Period | Focus | Primary Drivers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Early 80s** | Proprietary Systems | SNA, DECNet, Netware (Closed silos). |
| **Late 80s** | Interoperability | Interop Trade Show, TCP/IP standard. |
| **Early 90s** | Management/Scale | SNMP, emergence of private ISPs. |
| **Mid-90s+** | Information Services | World Wide Web, Browsers, E-commerce. |
