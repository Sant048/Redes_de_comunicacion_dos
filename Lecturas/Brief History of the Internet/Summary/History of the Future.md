# The Formal Identity and Future Horizon

In October 1995, the **Federal Networking Council (FNC)** provided the definitive legal and technical description of what constitutes the "Internet." This marked its transition from a research project to a globally recognized information system.
## 1. The FNC Definition (Oct 24, 1995)
The term **"Internet"** refers to a global information system that meets three criteria:
1. **Logically Linked:** Uses a globally unique address space based on the **Internet Protocol (IP)**.
2. **Standardized Protocols:** Supports communications via **TCP/IP** or other IP-compatible protocols.
3. **High-Level Services:** Provides or makes accessible public/private services layered on top of this communications infrastructure.
## 2. A Legacy of Adaptation
The Internet is a "creature of the computer," not the telephone industry. Its success lies in its ability to adapt to technological shifts that its original creators never envisioned:

| Era / Technology    | Original Design             | Modern Adaptation                                     |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Computing Model** | Time-sharing systems        | PCs, Client-Server, P2P, and Mobile                   |
| **Network Tech**    | Pre-dated LANs              | Integrated LAN, ATM, Frame Switching, Satellites      |
| **Functionality**   | Remote login & file sharing | Email, WWW, Audio/Video Streaming                     |
| **Scale**           | Small research community    | Global commercial success with billions in investment |
## 3. The New Paradigm: Nomadic Computing
The convergence of pervasive networking and portable devices (Laptops, PDAs, Cellular phones) has birthed **Nomadic Computing**. 
* **Real-Time Transport:** The network is evolving to support high-fidelity audio and video streams (IP Telephony and IP Television).
* **Broadband Evolution:** Adapting to broadband residential access and advanced satellite delivery.
* **Economic Realities:** Shifting to accommodate sophisticated pricing and cost recovery models in a commercial world.
## 4. The Challenge of the Future: Governance
The most pressing question for the Internet's future is not technical, but **social and organizational**.

> [!warning] The Stakeholder Struggle
> With success has come a proliferation of stakeholders with massive economic investments. The struggle to find a social structure to manage the Internet is visible in:
> * **Domain Name Space:** Debates over control of naming.
> * **Next-Gen IP (IPv6):** Managing the transition to a larger address space.
> * **Collective Direction:** The risk is not a lack of vision, but the difficulty of marching "collectively into the future" amidst competing interests.

This image provides a comprehensive visual timeline of the **Internet's organizational evolution** from its origins in 1968 through the mid-1990s. It maps out how the governance, milestones, and scale of the network shifted from a small military project to a global commercial infrastructure.
## 1. Governance and Leadership (Top Rows)

The top section shows the shifting "ownership" and coordination bodies of the network:

- **Funding Agencies (Purple):** The evolution moves from **DARPA** (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) to a joint effort including the **DCA** (Defense Communications Agency) and **NSF** (National Science Foundation), eventually transitioning to international and commercial bodies like the **FNC** (Federal Networking Council) and **CCIRN**.
    
- **The Governance Shift (Blue Blocks):** * **Early Era:** Coordination was handled by small "Working Groups" (ARPANET WG, Internet WG).
    
    - **1980s:** Specialized boards emerged, such as the **ICCB** (Internet Configuration Control Board).
        
    - **1986–1993:** The modern structure took shape with the **IAB** (Internet Activities Board, later Internet Architecture Board) and the **IETF** (Internet Engineering Task Force), which managed the engineering standards.
        
    - **1993+:** These bodies moved under the umbrella of the **Internet Society (ISOC)**, and the **W3C** (World Wide Web Consortium) was formed specifically for Web standards.

## 2. Key Historical Milestones (Middle Section)

The timeline highlights the "critical moments" that defined the network's capabilities:

- **1970s:** The demonstration of ARPANET and the invention of **TCP/IP**.
    
- **1983:** The **"Flag Day" transition** where the network switched from the old NCP protocol to TCP/IP, followed by the **MILNET/ARPANET split**, separating military operations from research.
    
- **Early 1990s:** The founding of the Internet Society and the explosion of the **World Wide Web**.

## 3. Exponential Growth (Bottom Green Bar)

The green bar at the bottom tracks the **number of operational networks** connected to the Internet, showing an astronomical increase in scale:

- **1968:** 0 networks.
    
- **1980:** 20 networks.
    
- **1986:** 500 networks (The start of the NSFNET era).
    
- **1993:** 19,000 networks (The commercial explosion).
    
- **1996:** **50,000+ networks**, signaling the birth of the modern global Internet.
